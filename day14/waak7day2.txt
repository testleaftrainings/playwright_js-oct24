Inheritance :
-----------
 acquring the property of parent by child
 build the relationship between two same type classes
 IS-A realtionship 
 redundancy od methods -->no need to duplicate the methods

keyword extends

type 
single Inheritance
multilevel inheritance 
 userReq extends Amazon
     Transaction extends userReq 


Multiple inheritance is not possible

Accessmodifier ->permission to use the methods/ property of the class

public -->accessible in all the classes
private-->accessible only within a class
  make visible to other classes -->set the perimission -->get set method
protected -->accessible by the extended family(classes-subclasses)


Ensapsulation ->binding the class properties and method together 
get and set method to provide accessbility on private variable

readonly-> like final and const variable -->cannot change the value of it 
static



Abstaction ->hiding the internal details and showing the required information
 -->designing the framework

abstact class  -->0 to 100% -Partial abstraction
interface -->100 % -Full abstraction

implementaion details 


Relationship between the classes 
-----------------------------
class extends another class
abstract class extends another abstract class
class extends abstract class
class implements interface 
abstract class implements interface
class extends abstract class implements interface
