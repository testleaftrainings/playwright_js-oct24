Javascript 
-----------
Livescript
 Programming language -->webDevelopment
 Front end development -->HTML/CSS
 Backend development

 ECMA-->2024
 ES16,

 client side validation 
 server side validation
 Event driven concept


js engine --->run the code
chrome -v8 engine 

 node.js -->runtime environment 
 js is faster 

 Varaibles--> containter -->store 
  store data/information in a varibale
variable =value
var username ="demo"

primitive 

string
number
boolean
undefined
null
bigint 1238494087900444n
symbol


var -->declaring the varible with value

var variableName =value 
not recommended  -->allows to use the duplicated varible 
 
 let -->keyword  -->doesnot allow duplicated varibales

var  vs  let (difference)

var -->can be redeclared and can be reassigned

let -->cannot be redeclared
    -->but can be reassigned

scoping  -->where to access it 
var -->global scoping/function scoping
let -->block -scoping (local variable)
 
-Operators
comparision
  ==
  !=
  >=
  <=

  to debug

  add breakpoints -->near line number
  goto sidebar(menu)-->runa nd debug
  click RunandDebug

  hoisting -->declaration moves top and then assignments happens


  var -->redeclared and reassigned
      -->global and function scoping
      -->hoisting can access the value before initialization
  
  let -->reassigned and cannot be redeclared
       -->block scoping
       -->hoisting -->at declartion but throws reference error -->cannot taccess the variable before initialization
