## Device Emulation

### Overview
- Playwright allows testing on different devices by emulating their characteristics (e.g., screen size, user agent).

### Use Cases
- **Responsive Testing**: Test how the application behaves on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verify that the application works across different browsers and devices.

### Example
  ```javascript
  const { devices } = require('playwright');
  const iPhone = devices['iPhone 12'];
  
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const context = await browser.newContext({
      ...iPhone,
      locale: 'en-US',
      geolocation: { longitude: 12.4924, latitude: 41.8902 },
      permissions: ['geolocation']
  });
  const page = await context.newPage();
  ```

## Geolocation

### Overview
- Playwright supports geolocation, allowing tests to simulate different geographic locations.

### Use Cases
- **Location-Based Testing**: Test applications that provide location-specific content or services.
- **Geofencing**: Verify the behavior of applications that restrict access based on user location.

### Example
  ```javascript
  await context.setGeolocation({ longitude: 12.4924, latitude: 41.8902 });
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  ```

## Console Logs

### Overview
- Playwright can capture and analyze console logs from the browser during test execution.

### Use Cases
- **Debugging**: Identify errors or warnings in the browser console during tests.
- **Logging**: Track and record important events that occur during test execution.

### Example
  ```javascript
  page.on('console', msg => console.log(msg.text()));
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  ```
## Network Interception

### Description
Playwright provides capabilities to intercept and modify network requests and responses. This can be useful for mocking API responses, modifying requests, or blocking certain resources.

### Use Case
Network interception is valuable for testing how an application handles various network conditions and responses. It can also be used to simulate backend endpoints that are not yet implemented or are unreliable.

### Example
javascript

  await page.route('**/api/**', route => {
    route.fulfill({
      status: 200,
      contentType: 'application/json',
      body: JSON.stringify({ data: 'mocked response' })
    });
  });

  await page.goto('https://login.salesforce.com');

## Visual Testing

### Description
Visual testing in Playwright involves comparing screenshots of web pages or elements to ensure they appear as expected. This helps catch visual regressions in the UI.

### Use Case
Automated visual testing ensures that UI changes do not unintentionally affect the appearance of web pages. Itâ€™s especially useful for validating design consistency and catching unexpected layout shifts or styling issues.


## Jira Integration

### Description
Integrating Jira with Playwright helps in tracking test results and associating them with Jira issues.

### Implementation
Use the Jira API to report test results from Playwright:

```javascript
const jiraClient = require('jira-client');

const jira = new jiraClient({
  protocol: 'https',
  host: 'your-jira-domain.atlassian.net',
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-api-token',
  apiVersion: '2',
  strictSSL: true,
});

jira.addNewIssue({
  fields: {
    project: { key: 'PROJ' },
    summary: 'Test Issue',
    description: 'Details about the issue',
    issuetype: { name: 'Bug' },
  },
});
```
## GitHub Actions

### Description
GitHub Actions allow you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying your code.

### Implementation
Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows` directory:

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
```
